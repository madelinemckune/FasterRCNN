# MInDS Presentation Template

This is an example template that you can use for presentations representing the team.

This example uses the Madrid theme with the [mines color theme](https://github.com/sbeleidy/beamer-mines).

Since many prefer the [metropolis theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), we should create another template that incorporates that and uses the MInDS logo, colors and fonts.
